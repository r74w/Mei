Imageboard Mei
==============

Mei is a Futaba-styled imageboard, allowing people to discuss and upload pictures. My aim is to improve the user interface to my liking, instead of mimicking the traditional Futaba look & feel.

The project is a practice for Ruby on Rails, but I try to make the code as maintainable as possible.

Post content is parsed as Markup. One can reply to other post by entering the post id as "> PostID" in the content.
